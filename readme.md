### README.md for LaTeX to Word Converter Extension

#### Overview
The LaTeX to Word Converter is a Chrome extension that allows users to convert LaTeX code into Word documents (.docx) seamlessly. This tool is particularly useful for academics, researchers, and anyone who frequently works with LaTeX documents and needs an easy way to convert them into a more universally accessible format.

#### Features
- **Simple Interface**: A user-friendly interface that allows for easy input of LaTeX code and a single button to convert it to a Word document.
- **Instant Download**: Converts and downloads the Word document directly through the browser.
- **Secure**: Utilizes environment variables and CORS to ensure secure and flexible API communication.

#### Components
1. **Frontend**: A Chrome extension that provides the user interface.
2. **Backend**: A server hosted on Render that handles the conversion from LaTeX to Word using Pandoc.

#### Installation and Usage
